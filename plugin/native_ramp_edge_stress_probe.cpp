// Targeted repro for the hypothesised La32Ramps freeze mechanism: serviceStuckPolicy()'s
// La32Ramps branch used to promote the NEXT queued ramp landing in the same tick the previous
// one was read, skipping the EXTINT falling edge entirely (Mcs96Cpu::setExtIntLine() only
// clears pending_irq's EXTINT bit on a real high-to-low transition - level 7 is deliberately
// excluded from the CPU's own auto-clear-on-take logic, so nothing else ever clears it). Two
// ramps landing close enough together - which single, fully-released notes essentially never
// do, but overlapping/legato notes and chords routinely do - meant the CPU could re-take the
// same never-cleared interrupt forever once PSW.F_I came back up after each RETI: a tight
// ISR-retrigger loop that keeps retiring instructions (so a same-PC hang check misses it) while
// the firmware's own mainline code - note dispatch, LCD refresh - never runs again.
//
// A same-PC check can't catch this (a tight loop visits several addresses, not one), so this
// probe instead watches for the actual user-visible symptom: RAM content going static despite
// continued MIDI input and continued firmware note-on/off completions. rampQueueDepthForTest()
// is also watched for an unbounded backlog, which a permanently-undelivered interrupt would
// also produce (every later landing just piles up in rampLanded_ forever).
