// envelope model - a voice's slot genuinely frees once its ramp lands, exactly as the real
// chip would report it) under a fast run of many short notes - la32Stub should start losing
// notes once the firmware's own 32-slot table fills; la32Ramps should keep taking them
// because slots actually come back.
