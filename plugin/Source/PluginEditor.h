// The front panel IS the reference photograph. docs/panel_reference.png is drawn as the
// background at 1:1 and every control is an invisible hit-region placed at coordinates measured
// off that photo (see docs/panel_reference_notes.md), so position and photorealism are both
// correct by construction rather than by hand-drawing.
//
// Only two things are ever painted over it:
//
//  * the LCD, replaced inside exactly the rectangle its window occupies in the photo. Its content
//    is the emulated MSM6222B's own rendered dot matrix, glyphs and all, so nothing here consults
//    a font - only the dot geometry and colours are ours (docs/lcd_reference.png);
//  * the MIDI MESSAGE lamp, the only indicator a D-110 has.
//
// Buttons and the VOLUME knob are never redrawn: the cap or the disc is cut straight out of the
// photograph, and the cut-out itself recedes into its recess or spins about its own axis.
//
// Emulator settings live on a right-click, never a control drawn onto the panel - the hardware
// has no such thing. Standalone-only items (Audio/MIDI Settings, save/load state, reset) are
// folded into the same menu too, now that the standalone window uses a native title bar and no
// longer has JUCE's own Options button to carry them (see D110AudioProcessorEditor's
// parentHierarchyChanged and D110Panel::showOptionsMenu).
