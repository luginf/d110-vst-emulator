// On-screen test keyboard: a two-octave mouse piano plus optional tracker-style PC
// keyboard input (QWERTY/AZERTY, FastTracker2/Impulse Tracker convention), MIDI
// channel/remap set via right-click. Talks to its owner only through D110KeyboardHost,
// so it works identically inside the plugin's own drawer and inside the independent
// Nonet Sequencer app's window.
//
// Two ways to strike a key: the mouse, on the drawn keys, and - opt-in, right-click to
// enable - the computer keyboard, in the layout every tracker (FastTracker2, Impulse
// Tracker, OpenMPT, Renoise...) has used since the 1990s: two overlapping rows, the lower
// one ZSXDCVGBHNJM,L.;/ starting at the current base octave, the upper one Q2W3ER5T6Y7UI9O0P
// one octave above it. QWERTY and AZERTY differ only in which CHARACTER a given physical
// key sends, not in the note it plays, so trackerKeys() carries both and the chosen layout
// just picks which column to compare incoming key text against.

	// finger, and only one octave fits comfortably. Clamped to [1,2] - nothing in rebuildKeys()
