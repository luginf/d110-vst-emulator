// alphabetically with a count per letter and an overall total (both shown once a scan has
// run); a chosen tone can either be dropped straight into a part for instant, non-destructive
// audition (double-click - see mouseDoubleClick()'s own comment), or written permanently into
// one chosen internal Tone Memory slot ("Inject to slot...", with a confirm step naming what
// it would overwrite - Alan's request, 2026-08-28: never silently clobber a slot he's using).
