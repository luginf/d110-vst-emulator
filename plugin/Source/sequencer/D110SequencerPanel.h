// D-20-style sequencer drawer: a transport strip plus one row per track (D-110 parts
// 1-8, then rhythm). Inside the plugin it's a third independently-foldable drawer,
// alongside D110EditorPane and D110Keyboard - see D110AudioProcessorEditor, which owns
// and positions this the same way it does those two. In the independent sequencer app
// (see NonetSeqHost, the independent Nonet Sequencer app) it's the whole window instead. Talks to its host only
// through D110SequencerHost, so this UI - like the engine itself - doesn't know anything
// about firmware RAM, and doesn't require one to exist.
