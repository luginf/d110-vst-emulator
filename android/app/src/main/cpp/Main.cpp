// Second Android milestone: the real engine (D110AudioProcessor/D110CoreNative), the real
// photographed front panel (D110Panel) with its original hit-tested buttons, the real
// on-screen keyboard (D110Keyboard), and (2026-08-22) the real sequencer - both its normal
// grid view (D110SequencerPanel, the default here, matching the desktop plugin's own default)
// and its retro D-pad+LCD view (D110SequencerRetroPanel, one Options tap away) - all reused
// unchanged from the desktop plugin, since all of them are already touch-compatible as-is
// (see the Android port investigation this follows up on). The grid view's right-click menus
// (quantize, tempo, load/save, ...) have no right mouse button to fire them on a touchscreen,
// so D110SequencerPanel itself grew a long-press equivalent (see its own mouseDown() comment)
// reaching the exact same menus - the retro view never needed this, having none at all (its
// own D-pad/button cluster covers everything a real D-20 does, only in a smaller frame). A
// long PRESS still doesn't belong on the piano keys themselves (see D110Keyboard.h's own note
// on why holding a key can't double as one - it's an ordinary sustained note), which is why
// that menu stays reachable from the hamburger instead. Deliberately NOT included: the
// extended editor drawer (Utility/Tone/Patches/... tabs), the memory card - out of scope for
// "as simple as possible" per the original brief, and nothing added since has needed them.
