# D-110 VST Emulator

A VST3 plugin that emulates the Roland D-110 multi-timbral sound module.

![screenshot](docs/D-110_vst01.jpg)

**It runs the D-110's real Roland firmware** - the menus, the display, the patch/timbre editors
and all sixteen front-panel buttons are the hardware's own, not a reimplementation - against an
emulated LA32 sound engine ([munt](https://github.com/munt/munt)). The plugin opens already
switched on, exactly like the hardware. See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for
how the two halves fit together, what the extended editor drawer does, and known limits.

## Get started

You need your own **D-110 ROM dumps** - copyrighted Roland firmware, **not included** here.
You can get them here: [https://mdk.cab/download/standalone/d110.7z](https://mdk.cab/download/standalone/d110.7z)

Put the files loose (not zipped) into:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\D-110 Data\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/D-110 Data/`
- Linux: `~/.vst3/D-110_Data/`

(Using the Standalone app rather than a DAW? `%APPDATA%\D-110 Emulator\D-110 Data\` /
`~/Library/Application Support/D-110 Emulator/D-110 Data/` / `~/.config/D-110 Emulator/D-110 Data/`
works too - see [`docs/roms.md`](docs/roms.md).)

Right-click the panel to see what was recognised. Full requirements, checksums, and what to do
if you only have `D-110_PCM.bin`/`D-110_Control.bin`: [`docs/roms.md`](docs/roms.md).

The doc in pdf format for the synthesizer is located at [https://cdn.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/D-110_OM.pdf](https://cdn.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/D-110_OM.pdf)

## Build

Requires CMake and a C++ compiler (Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows; GCC and
`libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libfontconfig1-dev libpulse-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu). JUCE is
fetched automatically by CMake on first configure.

```
cd plugin
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
```

This builds `D110EmulatorNative` - the default, MAME-free backend - and copies the `.vst3` to
your platform's shared VST3 folder automatically. For the opt-in MAME-backed backend and full
build details, see [`docs/building.md`](docs/building.md).
