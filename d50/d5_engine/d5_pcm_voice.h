// PCM partial of the LA engine: plays one of the 100 ROM samples at a pitch,
// through the TVA envelope. This is the half of LA synthesis that comes out
// of the sample ROMs; the synth partials (sawtooth/square with TVF, and the
// ring modulation that pairs them) are separate.
//
// There is no root pitch per sample anywhere in the machine. The firmware
// sends a PCM partial the pitch word a square would get, four octaves lower
// (IC25 0x0F49), and the chip turns that into a playback step by one rule
// for every sample -- see kPcmPitchRefHz below. Roland tuned the material to
// that rule, not the other way round: the sustained loops are 2^k-word
// cycles so they land on C octaves, and the attacks sit wherever the patch
// programmer's coarse puts them. Noise follows the key like everything else.

// Firmware IC25 0x0F44-0x0F4E (and again at 0x0F9A, the negative-keyfollow
// branch of the same composer) shifts the partial's type byte and, when the
// carry -- bit 7, the PCM flag -- is set, subtracts 0x4000 from the pitch
// word: exactly four octaves in the chip's 4096-per-octave scale. The chip
// itself (munt LA32WaveGenerator: synth step 2^(p/4096+4) over a 2^20
// period, PCM step 2^(p/4096+3) in 1/256 word) advances a PCM by
// f*2048/32000 words per output sample for the pitch word that makes a
// square wave sound at f. Together: words per sample = f / (32000/128) =
// f / 250 Hz. At coarse 36 on C4 that is 1.046, the stored rate -- which is
// also why every sustained loop is a 2^k-word cycle: 32000/2^k Hz times
// 261.6/250 lands them on the C octaves by construction. Nothing in the
// firmware carries a root pitch per sample; the PCM number only selects the
// start page and the length class (IC25 0x04B0-0x04CF). So the natural
// pitch of the material must not enter the playback rate - confirmed
// upstream (Michi71/PicoVintageSynthCollection PR #144, filed against
// Alan's own issue #142 reporting Pipe Solo's flute chiff two octaves low)
// and ported here in place of this port's own per-PCM hardcoded correction
// table, which was a same-day symptom patch for the same bug - see
// d5_patch_map.h's own history for that table's removal.
